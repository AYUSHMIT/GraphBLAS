--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUTURE plans For 9.0.1: and beyond:

GraphBLAS:

    don't just check 1st line of GraphBLAS.h when deciding to unpack
    the src in user cache folder. Use a crc test.

CUDA:

    finding src
    kernel source location, and name

Future features:

    pack/unpack COO
    kernel fusion
    CUDA kernels
    fine-grain parallelism for dot-product based mxm, mxv, vxm,
        then add GxB_vxvt (outer product) and GxB_vtxv (inner product)
        (or call them GxB_outerProduct and GxB_innerProduct?)

    aggregators
    index binary ops
    GrB_extract with GrB_Vectors instead of (GrB_Index *) arrays for I and J

    iso: set a flag with GrB_get/set to disable iso.  useful if the matrix is
    about to become non-iso anyway. Pagerank does:

        r = teleport (becomes iso)
        r += A*x     (becomes non-iso)

    apply: C = f(A), A dense, no mask or accum, C already dense: do in place

    JIT: allow a flag to be set in a type or operator to selectively control
        the JIT

    JIT: requires GxB_BinaryOp_new to give the string that defines the op.
    Allow use of
        GrB_BinaryOp_new (...)
        GrB_set (op, GxB_DEFN, "string"
    also for all ops
