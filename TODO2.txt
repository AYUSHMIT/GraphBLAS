FIXME: remove this file in the final stable release.

My ranking of importance of the current C API issues:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High priority:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    #51 remove GrB_SCMP

    #48 Consider adding descriptor to all methods
        this is extensive, but since the C API is changing (to v2.0)
        anyway, now is the time to consider this.

    #46 PAIR operator: essential for best performance on many problems

    #45 TRIL, TRIU, DIAG, OFFDIAG, ROWLE, ROWGT, COLLE, and COLGT: only need _INT64 versions
        simple change, but computations on unsigned ints break badly and so
        should not be added.

    #42 export of a matrix in full format when entries are missing: should be an error
        Make this an error, just like an empty GrB_Scalar is often an error.
        Exporting in bitmap is awkward and not a "dense" format.

    #36 Where are vector serialize/deserialize?

    #33 function signature for GrB_IndexUnaryOp

    #34 GxB_INDEX_MAX
        needed because index computations for IndexUnaryOps must be done in int64

    #32 named and defined operators and types
        also part of this issue: query the type of a matrix/vector/scalar

    #21 BB-37: GrB_Any Monoid and/or GrB_Either BinaryOp

    #3 BB-5: Pointers to allocators/deallocators

    #6 BB-14: Query size of scalar described by GrB_Type

    #7 BB-15: Query components of monoids and semirings

    #5 BB-13: Query the domains (types) of operators

    #4 BB-7: Query global execution mode

    #2 BB-4: Macro to identify the library implementation

    #12 BB-26: build()/extractTuples() that allow NULL arrays





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Low priority: most are useful or important, but can wait until the v2.1 C API:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    #50 GraphBLAS needs methods to sort a vector or matrix
        I've written GxB_Matrix_sort and GxB_Vector_sort

    #49 consider making GrB_DESC_S the default.
        this would require v3.0 C API since it breaks backward compatiblity

    #47 GrB_Vector_diag

    #41 "input-only" parameters when an error occurs

    #31 BB-71: Filling GraphBLAS matrices without calling GrB_Matrix_build()
        best way to do this is with O(1) move constructors; requires #3.

    #30 BB-66: Distributed support.

    #29 BB-65: Driver code for Appendix examples

    #28 BB-63: Improving Composability of GrB_init() and GrB_finalize()

    #27 BB-55: Clarify distributive law

    #26 BB-54: Operations involving implicit Kronecker product

    #24 BB-52: Support rank promotion

    #22 BB-38: No domain mismatch check if argument is not used

    #20 BB-35: New operation: GrB_subassign

    #17 BB-31: Pretty printing
        would be nice to have

    #16 BB-30: eWiseAdd with extra scalars for when entries are missing (and the implied zero does not work).

    #15 BB-29: Consider index array ranges/strides as accomplished with colon notation.

    #14 BB-28: Consider global get/set methods

    #13 BB-27: Descriptors query and default

    #11 BB-23: User-defined monoids with terminal values




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
could be closed: not so important after all
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    #9 BB-21: BinaryOps RMINUS and RDIV

    #10 BB-22: Extend boolean binary ops to T x T --> T


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should be closed:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    #25 BB-53: Pattern-only matrices and vectors

    #23 BB-48: General user-defined types (beyond trivially copyable)
