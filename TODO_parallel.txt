GraphBLAS/TODO_parallel.txt

Testing the parallel codes:  Most of my test suite is done through MATLAB
mexFunctions in the GraphBLAS/Test directory.  The mexFunctions link against
the GraphBLAS library, so do a "make install" and then use Test/testall.m in
MATLAB.  MATLAB can't link with a library compiled with the icc compiler, so
use gcc instead, if testing in MATLAB.

Alternatively: use the algorithms and main programs in LAGraph, For the
parallel qsort, use LAGraph/BuildMatrix/btest to test the parallel performance.

All parallel methods need tuning and benchmarking.

mostly done:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

GB_subassign*: mostly done, except three methods are suboptimal.

GB_subassign_select: one loop not parallel

GB_AxB_parallel: much is done: mxm nicely parallel for large matrices,
    and decent parallelism for mxv when using the dot product.  This is where
    we do C=A*B, for GrB_mxm, GrB_mxv, and GrB_vxm.  *FINE slice methods are
    written but need tuning.  Need better fine-grain methods for mxv and vxm:
    do symbolic analysis phase (column nnz count), and then compute C in place
    without the final copy.  See for example *dot2. Need to do the same for
    Gustavson's method and for the Heap method.  Need to add the SLICE methods
    to the descriptor.  Need to write a hash-based method.

GB_AxB_flopcount: better early exit, one loop not parallel

Template/GB_reduce_each_index: one loop not parallel

GB_add_phase0: done, except one loop not parallel
    (for the merge when both A and B are hypersparse)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in progress
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Template/GB_qsort_template:
    Needs a way to set a larger leaf task size.
    Odd segfault with 20 threads.  see "TODO"
