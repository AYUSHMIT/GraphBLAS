GraphBLAS/TODO_parallel.txt: Here are a list of the Source/*.c files that need
to be done in parallel.  I've roughly sorted them by priority and partly by the
low-hanging fruit (some will be quick to do).  You can find them all with:

cd GraphBLAS/Source
grep -r PARALLEL: .

Testing the parallel codes:  Most of my test suite is done through MATLAB
mexFunctions in the GraphBLAS/Test directory.  The mexFunctions link against
the GraphBLAS library, so do a "make install" and then use Test/testall.m in
MATLAB.  MATLAB can't link with a library compiled with the icc compiler, so
use gcc instead, if testing in MATLAB.

Alternatively: use the algorithms and main programs in LAGraph, For the
parallel qsort, use LAGraph/BuildMatrix/btest to test the parallel performance.

Only GrB_assign and GxB_subassign use the more complex iterators (GBI2, GBI2s,
GBI3, GBI3s), which iterate over multiple matrices at the same time.  They can
be ignored for now; they iterate over a set union of 2 or more lists.  They are
currently not easily parallelizable and need to be replaced with simpler loops
to parallelize them.

All parallel methods need tuning and benchmarking.

mostly done:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

GB_AxB_parallel: much is done: mxm nicely parallel for large matrices,
    and decent parallelism for mxv when using the dot product.  This is where
    we do C=A*B, for GrB_mxm, GrB_mxv, and GrB_vxm.  *FINE slice methods are
    written but need tuning.  Need better fine-grain methods for mxv and vxm:
    do symbolic analysis phase (column nnz count), and then compute C in place
    without the final copy.  See for example *dot2. Need to do the same for
    Gustavson's method and for the Heap method.  Need to add the SLICE methods
    to the descriptor.  Need to write a hash-based method.

GB_AxB_flopcount: done, except needs an better early exit.

GB_add_phase0: done, except for the merge when both A and B are hypersparse.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
in progress
----------------------------------------------------------------------

GB_subassigner: in progress

Template/GB_qsort_template:
    Needs a way to set a larger leaf task size.
    Does lots of work, everywhere, for many GraphBLAS operations.
    Odd segfault with 20 threads.  see "TODO"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
not started:  GrB_assign and GxB_subassign:  C(I,J)=A
----------------------------------------------------------------------

GB_assign:
    Does the work of GrB_*_assign.  Most of the work is in GB_subassigner,
    but does work for the C_replace_phase, to create zombies in C outside of
    the IxJ submatrix.
