THIS IS A DRAFT.  The following features/revisions will appear in the stable
v8.0.0 release:

* NOTE: remove prior JIT kernels!

    If you have JIT kernels in your ~/.SuiteSparse/GraphBLAS/8.0.0 folder,
    delete them.  Normally, a new version of GraphBLAS will create a new folder
    and ignore the old one, but this draft is still numbered 8.0.0.  Its
    kernels are incompatible with the earlier DRAFT* versions of 8.0.0,
    however.

* Windows:

    The JIT needs to be ported to Windows.  This draft will not compile on
    Windows with the JIT enabled.  I think it will compile with -DNJIT
    but I haven't tested it.

* FIXMEs:

    Some FIXME's tagged in the Source/ folder.
    These need to be done for v8.0.0.

* Thread-safety:

    GraphBLAS is thread-safe when used in a single multithreaded user
    application, even when multiple user threads try to compile the same JIT
    kernel at the same time.  However, if the user runs multiple instances of
    GraphBLAS at the same time, from entirely different user processes, and
    each of them attempts to compile the same JIT kernels, a file read/write
    conflict will occur on your ~/.SuiteSparse/GraphBLAS/8.0.0 folder.  I need
    a portable file-locking mechanism for Linux/Unix, Mac, and Windows.  As a
    short-term workaround, each user application should use its own cache
    folder, instead of sharing a single default cache folder.

FIXME: delete this file in the final stable v8.0.0 release

FIXME: exhaustive Tcov tests, with all 4 combinations of:
    (NJIT on/off) x (COMPACT on/off)
    also do the same exhaustive tests in ./Test but with GB_DEBUG enabled
