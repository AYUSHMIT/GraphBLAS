FIXME:  do O(1) typecasting for iso matrices, if their types don't match
    the operator.  Do this after WAIT on the inputs, since that may
    change the iso property.

FIXME:  after non-iso GrB*build, check if matrix is iso

FIXME: in GraphBLAS/Test/GB_mx_mxArray_to_Matrix: provide option for checking
    input matrix to see if could be presented as iso

FIXME: pack/unpack

FIXME: set print1

FIXME: in gbtest47:
.............OMP: Warning #190: Forking a process while a parallel region is active is potentially unsafe.
