FIXME / TODO: for v8.0.0.draft:

    port to the Mac

    performance tests (GAP, etc)

    rename GBCUDA_DEV to GBCOMPACT and document it

    wildtype output (for smaller diff)

FIXME / TODO for 8.0.1.draft:

    MATLAB interface (testing, and @GrB)

    pre-constructed JIT kernels:  copy ~/.SuiteSparse/GraphBLAS/8.0.0/cpu/*.c
        to GraphBLAS/Source/PreJIT (or something).  Recompile GraphBLAS;
        cmake finds the list of sources in PreJIT/*.c.

    more JIT kernels: GrB_assign (34 kernels), subref (3 kernels),
        masker (2 kernels), other (5 kernels)

    port to Windows
