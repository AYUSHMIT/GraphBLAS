THIS IS A DRAFT.  The following features/revisions will appear in the stable
v8.0.0 release:

* NOTE: remove prior JIT kernels!

    If you have JIT kernels in your ~/.SuiteSparse/GraphBLAS/8.0.0 folder,
    delete them.  Normally, a new version of GraphBLAS will create a new folder
    and ignore the old one, but this draft is still numbered 8.0.0.  Its
    kernels are incompatible with the earlier DRAFT* versions of 8.0.0,
    however.

FIXME: testing, release date, delete this file (TODO.txt), test on Windows

    exhaustive Tcov tests:
    with all 4 combinations of: (NJIT on/off) x (COMPACT on/off)
    also do the same exhaustive tests in ./Test but with GB_DEBUG enabled
