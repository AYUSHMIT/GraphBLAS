v5.1.0.BETA1 (June 22, 2021)

This is a beta release.  It works fine on Linux and has reached
100% test coverage.  It might not compile on Windows or the Mac;
that will be checked shortly.  Here's what's left to do:

FIXME: GAP benchmarks (do this before releasing v5.1.0.BETA1)

do this after BETA1:
FIXME: check Octave port
FIXME: check R2021a port
FIXME: check Mac port
FIXME: check Windows port
FIXME: reduce the test cov time (start with test77)
