FUTURE: can handle transpose of full or bitmap input matrices just by
changing how they are accessed

FUTURE: add matrix I/O in binary format (see draft LAGraph_binread/binwrite)

PR:

    FUTURE: constant-valued matrices/vectors (for r(:)=teleport)
        probably coupled with lazy malloc/free of A->x when converting from
        full (non-constant) to constant-valued

    need aggressive exploit of non-blocking mode, for x = sum (abs (t-r)),
    or GrB_vxv dot product, with PLUS_ABSDIFF semiring
