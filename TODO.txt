FUTURE: can handle transpose of full or bitmap input matrices just by
changing how they are accessed

FUTURE: add matrix I/O in binary format (see draft LAGraph_binread/binwrite)

CC: TODO::benchmark this
    lots of conversion of full to sparse for vector export.

TODO: need a matrix/vector import/export that never does conversion

    TODO: constant-valued matrices/vectors (for r(:)=teleport)
        probably coupled with lazy malloc/free of A->x when converting from
        full (non-constant) to constant-valued

    need aggressive exploit of non-blocking mode, for x = sum (abs (t-r))

TC:  TODO:: figure out why Feb 21st results are faster than Aug 2nd and current
