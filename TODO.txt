TODO:

Add JIT control get/set to @GrB MATLAB interface

Use function pointers to any required GB* routines in a single struct, so the
JIT can pass it to each JIT kernel.  Then the JIT kernel does not need to
be linked against libgraphblas.so itself.

Ingest all of Source/Template into libgraphblas.so itself, compressing it first
with zstd.  Then GrB_init can write all this source code into
~/.SuiteSparse/GraphBLAS/8.0.0_source (for example).  Then the
GRAPHBLAS_SOURCE_PATH can be removed.

Port to Windows

See also the list in the user guide for other pending tasks.

Can some "seq_cst" atomic clauses be safely removed?
