TODO: create GB_mergesort_2 and GB_mergesort_3, which compute the same thing as
    GB_qsort_2 and GB_qsort_3, but using a parallel merge sort.  They will call
    the single-threaded GB_qsort_2 and GB_qsort_3 for sorting small sub-arrays,
    in the leaf nodes of the task tree.

TODO: for production release, remove User/my*.m4
