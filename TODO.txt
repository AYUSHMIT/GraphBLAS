FIXME:  do O(1) typecasting for iso matrices, if their types don't match
    the operator.  Do this after WAIT on the inputs, since that may
    change the iso property.

FIXME: after non-iso GrB*build, check if matrix is iso

FIXME: in GraphBLAS/Test/GB_mx_mxArray_to_Matrix: provide option for checking
    input matrix to see if it could be presented as iso

FIXME: pack/unpack

FIXME: use GB_blob16 for all GB_16BYTE cases

FIXME: if no typecasting, replace GB_type* methods with GB_1BYTE ... GB_16BYTE
    cases
