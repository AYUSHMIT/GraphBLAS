LAGraph agenda, Aug 11, 2021

    testing status:
        added a libgraphblas_test.so (OK?), so it can be used in
            src/test, src/benchmark, experimental/test,
            experimental/benchmark, etc.
        tests done for Triangle Count (TC), BFS, SSSP, CC.
        need tests for Betweeness Centrality (BC), PageRank (Pr)
        need tests for LAGraph_DeleteDiag

    added utility: LAGraph_DeleteDiag (G, msg)

    lots of todo's in CC method, some in SSSP
    some TODOs in src/test, src/utility

    need to select a consist set of error return values (-1000, -1001, ...)

    top-level Makefile: why not?  julia has one
        ("make" could do "mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake .. ; make", etc)

    LAGraph binary read/write
        SuiteSparse-specific?
        general binary format, based on the draft 2.0 spec
            for import/export formats?
