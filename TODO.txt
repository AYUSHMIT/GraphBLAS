TODO: for Microsoft Windows:

 * MS Visual Studio can't build the demos. "cannot open
        Release\graphblasdemo.lib".  The build/Release folder contains
        graphblas.dll and graphblas.lib, but only
        graphblasdemo.dll, graphblasdemo_static.lib.

 * MATLAB mexFunctions can't find the graphblas.dll (or .lib) in
        GraphBLAS/build/Release, even though that folder is in the
        system path.  To get this to work, the GraphBLAS library can
        be loaded via the following, in the MATLAB Command Window:
            cd build/Release ; GrB(1)
        but this is awkward.

 * GraphBLAS/Test and GraphBLAS/Tcov are not yet ported to MS Visual Studio.
