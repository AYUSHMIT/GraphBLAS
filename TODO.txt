v5.1.0.BETA1 (June 25, 2021)

This is a beta release.  It works fine on Linux and has reached
100% test coverage.  It might not compile on Windows or the Mac;
that will be checked shortly.  Here's what's left to do:

FIXME: Mac port fails (argument list too long in cmake)
FIXME: check Windows port
FIXME: delete this file

FIXME: move GB_sel* and GB_AxB__any_pair_iso.c to another folder.
