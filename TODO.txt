extend saxpy5 vectorization to single complex and double complex

Change min/max monoids for fp32 nd fp64: not terminal

Split saxpy_generic.c into multiple modules.  Also dot2, dot3, generics?

clang/icx: silence or find warnings about failed vectorization

Apple clang: silence the many warnings in the @GrB interface?
(clang doesn't work for MATLAB anyway...)

Linux: try clang
